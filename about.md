Currently I'm working as technical team leader for Onwelo. Beside that I'm host of the copmany branch located in Kielce. Once I was a Ph.D. student on AGH University of Science and Technology in the field of Computer Science (with the focus on artificial intelligence) but for now I have abandon that. Apart from that I'm a husband, a brewer (3rd beer already done!), gamer and traveler.
